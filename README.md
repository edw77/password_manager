# password_manager
Password Manager in CLI wrote in Python & using a Postgresql database inspired by Kalle Hallden (https://www.youtube.com/c/KalleHallden)

With this, you can :
* Enter your passwords (RSA-encrypted in the database), and link them to sites (via URL) or usernames
* Delete, modify or simply read them
* Generate random passwords
* Two factor authentification to open the application (work in progress)
